BackupHome v2 is now BackD
-------------
Backup any directory to a specified directory or drive in a tar.gz folder

Pros:
+ Allows you to pick which files and directories you want to keep in the tar.gz
+ tar.gz file compression for saving storage
+ Backup any directory

Cons:
- Literally none besides that you have to phisically compile it yourself

TODO:
-----
- Make it so that you can't just go around and put invalid directories
- Add more command line arguments
- If read/write not allowed, ask for sudo

ADDED JUST NOW:
---------------
- New experimental command line argument
- Support for any directory
